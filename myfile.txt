TASK: Add a new ?Combination Plot? for multi-ticker runs. Additive only; do not change any existing plots/tables/charts.

HARD CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT modify any existing plotter/table/chart code or outputs.
- Only modify:
  1) config.py
  2) NEW file: combination_plotter.py
- No other files edited.

CONFIG (config.py)
- Add:
  COMBINATION_PLOT = True   # default True

NEW FILE (combination_plotter.py)
- Codex should pull required data directly from the local database (same sources used today).
- Generate an additional figure only when:
  - COMBINATION_PLOT is True
  - AND selected tickers count >= 2

FIGURE: ?Combination Plot? (2 main panels)
Panel 1 (top): multi-ticker overlay (Daily Short Sale)
Panel 2 (bottom): multi-subplot Accumulation Score bars (stacked subplots)

PANEL 1: Overlaid ?Daily Short Sale? (multi-ticker overlay)
- Replicate the existing ?Daily Short Sale? panel style from plotter.py (axes, labels, scales, dots).
- Plot each ticker as a separate colored line:
  - No special markers other than the existing daily dots (match current dot style).
  - Deterministic per-ticker colors (consistent within the run).
- Add WEIGHTED AVERAGE line:
  - color: white
  - thicker than individual lines
  - on top (higher zorder)

PANEL 2: Accumulation Score (MULTIPLE SUBPLOTS, bars only; no lines)
Panel 2 is a vertical stack of subplots, each identical in style to Panel 4 (Accumulation Score) in plotter.py, but:
- Bars only (no lines anywhere in Panel 2)
- Shared x-axis (dates) across all Panel 2 subplots
- Consistent y-axis behavior across subplots (match existing Panel 4 rules)

Subplots within Panel 2:
- Plot 2.1: Weighted Accumulation Score bar plot (all tickers combined)
  - Bars represent the weighted average Accumulation Score per day.
  - Emphasize as the ?summary? row (Codex chooses best emphasis consistent with theme).

- Plot 2.2: Ticker #1 Accumulation Score bar plot
  - Bars represent ticker #1 Accumulation Score per day.
  - Add a left-side label with the ticker symbol:
    - rotated 90 degrees
    - large font
    - bold
    - color matches ticker #1 color used in Panel 1

- Plot 2.3: Ticker #2 Accumulation Score bar plot
  - Same as above, with ticker #2 label in ticker #2 color.

- Continue: Plot 2.(n+1) for each additional ticker, in the same order as selected tickers.

WEIGHTED AVERAGES
- Compute weighted averages per-date:
  - Align on dates.
  - If missing data for a ticker on a date, compute over available tickers with renormalized weights.
- Weights:
  - Use existing project logic/source (DB/config) if present; otherwise fallback to equal weights.

DATA REQUIREMENTS (pulled from DB)
- For each ticker:
  - The exact series used for the ?Daily Short Sale? plot (Panel 1)
  - The exact Accumulation Score values used in Panel 4 (for Panel 2 subplots)
- Do not recompute metrics differently; reuse the same values/fields as current plots.

OUTPUT
- Save as a new artifact without affecting existing outputs.
- Use existing output directory conventions.
- Filename example:
  combination_plot_<market_date>_<tickers_slug>.png
- Ensure uniqueness to avoid overwrites.

GUARDS / NO-OPS
- If COMBINATION_PLOT is False: do nothing.
- If < 2 tickers: do nothing.
- If required DB tables/fields are missing: raise a clear error listing missing elements.

DELIVERABLES
- config.py: add COMBINATION_PLOT = True
- combination_plotter.py: implement DB query + figure generation + save output (Panels 1 and 2 as specified)
