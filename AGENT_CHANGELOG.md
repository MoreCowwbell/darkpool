# Agent Changelog

This file tracks completed tasks and in-progress work across sessions.  
Each entry should be short, bullet-based, and written immediately after a task is completed.

Format:
- Use checkboxes for completed tasks.
- Use a "⧗" prefix for tasks that are in progress (not yet finished).
- Keep each bullet to one line.
- Keep total log size manageable (older items can be summarized or archived periodically).
